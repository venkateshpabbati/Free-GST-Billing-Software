3. The page will show all returns for that period. Find "GSTR-1" tile.
4. Click "PREPARE ONLINE" if you have fewer than 500 invoices. Click "PREPARE OFFLINE" if you have 500+ invoices (you'll download the offline tool, import the JSON from this app, and upload).
5. For QRMP scheme users: Select the quarter end month. You file quarterly but can use IFF (Invoice Furnishing Facility) monthly for B2B invoices.

                        <li><strong>From July 2025:</strong> Table 3 auto-populates from GSTR-1 — just VERIFY, don't re-enter values.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITC matching:</strong> Always check GSTR-2B statement BEFORE claiming ITC. Go to Returns → GSTR-2B → Download. Only claim ITC that appears in GSTR-2B.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITC utilization order (Section 49):</strong> IGST credit first (against IGST → CGST → SGST), then CGST (against CGST → IGST), then SGST (against SGST → IGST).</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Use Electronic Credit Ledger (ITC) first. Pay remaining via Electronic Cash Ledger. Create challan via Services → Payments → Create Challan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interest calculation:</strong> If you file late, interest is 18% p.a. calculated on tax payable (not total liability). Interest starts from day after due date.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reverse charge:</strong> If you paid RCM (restaurant/legal/GTA services), report in 3.1(d) AND claim ITC in Table 4(A)(3).</li>
