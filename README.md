## ⚡ Install in 60 Seconds — one launcher per platform

**As of v1.10.44**, the download ZIP has **one clean file** at the root (the launcher for your OS) and everything else tucked into a hidden `_system/` folder. Extract the ZIP, double-click the launcher, done.

```
1. Download the release ZIP → https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/releases/latest
2. Right-click the ZIP → Extract All → pick a folder you'll remember
3. Double-click the launcher for your OS:
       Windows:  🚀 Free GST Billing.hta     (opens a real UI with buttons)
       macOS:    🚀 Free GST Billing.command (opens Terminal)
       Linux:    🚀 Free GST Billing.sh      (opens Terminal — chmod +x first if needed)
```

The launcher:
- Detects if Node.js is installed; installs it on Windows automatically if missing
- Runs `npm install` inside `_system/` (one-time, ~2 min)
- Creates a **Desktop shortcut** + **Start-Menu entry** so you never open the folder again
- Starts the server and opens your browser at **http://localhost:47371**

From then on, click the Desktop shortcut. To update / backup / restore / move to another PC / stop the server — use the new in-app **⚙ Control Panel** in the sidebar. No batch files, no CMD windows.

> **☁ Want to run it online instead (access from multiple devices)?** See the full **[Online Deployment Guide → docs/DEPLOY_ONLINE.md](./docs/DEPLOY_ONLINE.md)** — four paths compared (Railway lift-and-shift, Vercel + Supabase serverless, own VPS, free Cloudflare Tunnel) with costs, trade-offs, SQL schema, and code snippets. Read the trade-offs first — the local install is still the right answer for ~95% of users.

## Your First Invoice in 5 Minutes

A step-by-step guide for the *very first* invoice you create after installing. Targeted at users who've never used billing software before.

### Before you start
You need: Windows 10/11 PC, ~50 MB free disk, your business name + bank details (optional, can be added later). **No coding knowledge required.** No internet needed after install.

### Step 1 — Install (1 minute)

1. Download `Free-GST-Billing-vX.Y.Z.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/releases/latest).
   (Do **not** use the green *Code -> Download ZIP* button — that gives the source code without the built app.)
2. Right-click the downloaded ZIP → **Extract All** → pick a folder you'll remember (e.g. `Documents\FreeGSTBill`)
3. Open that folder → **double-click `Install FreeGSTBill.bat`**
4. Let it run — it installs Node.js automatically if you don't have it, then sets everything up. Takes 1–2 minutes the first time
5. The app opens in your browser at `http://localhost:47371` when done

> 💡 **Tip:** Click the small **Install App** icon in your browser's address bar to make the app open in its own window like Tally or Word — no browser chrome, looks and feels native.

### Step 2 — Set up your business profile (1 minute)

The Welcome Wizard appears automatically on first launch.

1. **Welcome screen** → pick your region:
   - 🇮🇳 **India only** — enables GST, GSTR-1/3B, UPI QR, E-Way Bill
   - 🌍 **Outside India** — enables VAT / SST / MwSt / TVA labels for 21 other countries
   - 🌐 **Both** — keeps everything visible (default)
2. **Business Details** → fill in your business name and address. Add GSTIN if you have one (leave blank if not GST-registered). PAN is optional.
3. **Bank & UPI** → add one bank account + your UPI ID so clients can pay you. You can add more accounts later from Settings → Payment Accounts.
4. Click **Done** → you land on the empty Dashboard

### Step 3 — Create your first invoice (2 minutes)

1. Click **+ New Invoice** in the sidebar
2. Pick the invoice type: **Tax Invoice** for GST-registered sales, **Bill of Supply** for exempt goods, **Proforma** for quotes, **Delivery Challan** for goods movement
3. Pick **📦 Goods** or **⏱ Services** at the top — this drives the default unit (Nos for goods, Hrs for services)
4. Type the client's name in the **Bill To** field. If you've billed them before they auto-suggest. Otherwise click **+ Save as new client** and fill the modal.
5. Add line items in the table:
   - **Description** — what you sold/did
   - **Qty** — how much
   - **Unit** — pick from the dropdown (Nos/Kg/Ltr for goods; Hrs/Day/Session for services). Click **＋ Add custom…** for things like *Carat* / *Bundle*
   - **Rate** — price per unit
   - **Tax %** — picks from your country's standard rates (5/12/18/28% for India; 5% for UAE; etc.)
6. Click **Download PDF** in the top-right

That's it. The PDF saves to `Saved Invoices/<Client Name>/<Month>/` and the invoice is logged in your bills list with a unique number.

### Step 4 — Send to your client (1 minute)

After clicking Download PDF you get three sharing options inline:

- 📱 **WhatsApp** — opens WhatsApp Web/Desktop with the PDF link prefilled to the client's number
- 📧 **Email** — opens your default mail app with the invoice summary
- ☁ **Google Drive** — auto-uploads (optional, requires you to configure your Google Client ID once in Settings)

### Step 5 — Track payment (whenever)

Open the Dashboard. The invoice shows in the list with a status badge.

- Click the **💰** icon to record a payment (full or partial) — date, mode, note
- The status updates automatically (`unpaid` → `partial` → `paid`)
- Overdue invoices get a red row + days-overdue counter automatically once the due date passes
- Use the **🔔 Notifications** bell in the sidebar to see overdue invoices and upcoming GST filing deadlines

### What to do next

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore:

- **Recurring invoices** — tick "🔁 Make this recurring" in the Customize panel of any invoice. The app auto-generates it monthly/weekly/yearly on your chosen date.
- **Multi-currency** — billing an overseas client? Open Customize → Currency → USD/EUR/GBP/AED/etc. The PDF renders the right symbol, locale formatting, and amount-in-words.
- **GST Returns** — sidebar → GST Returns. Filter by month/quarter/FY, click **JSON Export** to download GSTR-1 / GSTR-3B ready for the GST portal offline tool.
- **GSTR-2B Reconciliation** — download your 2B JSON from gst.gov.in, click Import in our 2B tab — we auto-match against your purchase records and flag mismatches.
- **TDS / TCS** — Customize → tick TDS or TCS, pick a section (194Q / 206C(1H) / etc.). The Reports view aggregates these for Form 26Q / 27EQ filing.

📖 **Full walkthrough** — see [docs/USER_GUIDE.md](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) or the in-app **User Guide** view (searchable, includes PDF download).

If we priced every 🆕 feature at the going rate on the paid alternatives:

- **Custom PDF branding + design presets**: paid tier on Vyapar, Zoho, ClearTax
- **Multi-copy Rule 48**: Vyapar Gold (₹3,999/yr), Tally paid module

- **Auto-print payment receipts**: standard on ClearTax + Zoho Standard
- **Bulk export**: paid tier on all four
- **Daily backup with Trash bin**: cloud-only (paid) on Zoho + ClearTax
- **ITR module** (with 234B/C, surcharge cap, 80D senior tiers): ClearTax sells this as a separate ~₹1,500/yr product
- **Multi-language invoices**: Tally paid module

**Total that would cost you ~₹8,000–₹15,000/year on the competing stack.** Here: **₹0, forever, MIT-licensed.**

## Key Features

> 🆕 **What's new (v1.10.30 → v1.10.42, shipped 2026)**
>
> - **Direct-HTML vector thermal print** (v1.10.42) — 58/80mm receipts skip the raster PDF path and go straight to the printer as vector text. Sharp glyphs on 203-dpi thermal heads, smaller print jobs. User-toggle to switch back to Via-PDF for finicky printers.
> - **Payment / receipt reconciliation** (v1.10.41) — Dashboard auto-heals any orphaned receipts against their invoice; stale-editor saves can no longer wipe a payment recorded in another tab.
> - **REPRINT badge polish** (v1.10.41) — moved to top-right so it never overlaps the logo; default OFF for freelancers/services (retail/POS can opt in).
> - **Bill of Supply / Delivery Challan** (v1.10.39) — the "no GST" invoice types now correctly remove GST from the invoice total.
> - **PDF colour crash fix** (v1.10.40) — swapped `color-mix(in oklab, …)` for `rgba()`; PDF Save & Download works on every browser again.
> - **Invoice PDF polish** (v1.10.38) — accent-tinted TOTAL DUE anchor, footer-block containers matching Bill To, smart Terms format default (services → formatted, goods → compact).
> - **Payment Accounts — Account Holder Name + Account Type** (v1.10.37) — invoices now show whose name is on the bank and whether it's Savings/Current.
> - **Portal print preview + settings redesign + business-type gating** (v1.10.36) — split-view collapses to one column on mobile, sections gated by business preset (freelancer no longer sees thermal-only options), reusable page-header card across every screen.
> - **Vector-HTML thermal preview + OCR line items** (v1.10.35) — OCR now extracts HSN / qty / rate / tax% per line and fuzzy-matches your saved product catalogue.
> - **In-app ConfirmModal + PromptModal** (v1.10.34) — every native browser confirm/prompt replaced with a theme-aware in-app modal.
> - **Complete 4-mode discount system** (v1.10.25) — Net / Unit / Price-with-Tax + invoice-level Total discount.
> - **Client credit balance** (v1.10.24) — overpayments carry forward and apply to the next bill automatically.
> - **Focus mode + Ctrl+K command palette + Notification bell** (through v1.10.36) — keyboard-first workflow for POS speed.
>
> Full history: [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). Earlier v1.10 milestones (UTGST bucket, GST Rule 48 multi-copy, 9 design presets, print margins, multi-language labels, daily backup + Trash bin, transactional restore) remain — see the feature tables below.

Each preset shapes **both PDF colours + thermal typography** in one click |

## Quick Start / Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** for the one-click installer, **OR** **Node.js 18+** for macOS / Linux
- ~50 MB free disk space
- No internet after install (except for optional Google Drive backup / update check)

### Option 1: Windows One-Click Installer (recommended — no terminal, no commands)

1. **Download the ZIP** → [click here](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/releases/latest) or grab the latest from [Releases](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/releases)
2. **Extract** it anywhere (e.g. `Documents\FreeGSTBill`)
3. **Double-click** `Install FreeGSTBill.bat`
4. The app opens at **http://localhost:47371** — a **Desktop shortcut** and **Start-Menu entry** are created for you

That's it. The installer auto-installs Node.js if you don't have it. From then on, click the Desktop shortcut to launch. Use `Stop FreeGSTBill.bat` to shut the server down and `Update FreeGSTBill.bat` to pull the latest release without losing your data.

> **Why port 47371?** IANA-unassigned range, well above the 3000-range that every dev server fights over. If it's ever busy, the server auto-scans upward and writes the chosen port to `data/port.txt` — the Start launcher always opens the right URL. Always use the Desktop shortcut.

### Option 2: macOS / Linux (Developer Setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software.git
cd Free-GST-Billing-Software
npm install
npm start                # production build + serve on http://localhost:47371
```

For live-reload development:

```bash
npm run dev              # dev server on http://localhost:5173 · API on http://localhost:47371
```

### Option 3: Install as a Desktop App (any OS)

Once the server is running, open the URL in Chrome / Edge / Brave and click **Install** in the address bar. The app gets its own window, icon, and jump-list — see [Install as a Desktop App (PWA)](#install-as-a-desktop-app-pwa) below.

### Option 4: Deploy online (advanced — Vercel + Supabase, Railway, VPS, Cloudflare Tunnel)

For solo users who want access from multiple devices, or small teams sharing invoices across a shop and an accountant's laptop — **[docs/DEPLOY_ONLINE.md](./docs/DEPLOY_ONLINE.md)** walks through four honest paths (Railway lift-and-shift, Vercel + Supabase serverless, own VPS, free Cloudflare Tunnel) with costs, trade-offs, and code snippets.

> **Read the trade-offs first.** Going online means your business data lives on someone else's server — the local install exists precisely to avoid that. For most users the local install is still the right answer.

## Install as a Desktop App (PWA)

Free GST Billing Software is a **Progressive Web App** — once installed, it gets its own icon, its own window, and behaves exactly like a regular Windows / macOS / Linux app. No browser chrome, no localhost URL visible to the user.

### How to install as a PWA

1. Open **http://localhost:47371** in Chrome / Edge / Brave (any Chromium browser)
2. Click the orange **Install as Desktop App** banner at the top — or the **➕ install icon** in the address bar
3. The app opens in its own window with the GST Billing Software icon in your Start Menu / taskbar

### After installation — manifest shortcuts

Right-click the pinned PWA icon (Windows taskbar / Start Menu / Edge's app launcher) and you get a jump-list:

- 🆕 **New Invoice** → straight to the invoice form
- 📊 **Dashboard** → recent invoices and stats
- 📋 **GST Returns** → GSTR-1 / 3B / 2B reconciliation
- ⚙ **Settings** → business profile, accounts, modules

No need to land on the Dashboard first — jump directly to the most-used flow.

### Offline-first

The PWA caches its full app shell + fonts + icons on first install. Even if your localhost server isn't running for some reason, the app still loads (and tells you the server is offline rather than just showing a blank page). Service worker auto-updates the cache when you upgrade.

> 🪟 **Coming in v2.0:** Native `.exe` installer (Tauri repackage) with code-signed binary, Add/Remove Programs entry, system tray icon, and native auto-update. The PWA flow stays as the developer / power-user fallback.

## How to Self-File GST Returns

Free GST Billing Software auto-generates all the data you need for GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B filing. Here's the workflow:

```
Step 1 ──► Enter invoices throughout the month as you normally would
              │
Step 2 ──► Go to GST Returns page → Review GSTR-1 data (B2B, B2C, HSN, Credit Notes)
              │
Step 3 ──► Export GSTR-1 JSON → Upload directly to gst.gov.in
              │
Step 4 ──► Review GSTR-3B summary → Copy figures into the GST portal and file
              │
Step 5 ──► Mark the return as filed to track your compliance status
```

The app includes a **step-by-step interactive filing guide** with screenshots and tips for both GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. It even covers NIL return filing for months with no activity.

> **No CA needed for basic GST filing.** The app does all the calculations — you just upload and confirm.

## Why Is This Free?

We believe every business in India deserves professional billing software without paying monthly fees.

---

## Data Privacy & Security

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where is my data stored?** | In a `data/` folder on your computer as plain JSON files. No server, no cloud, no database. |
| **Can anyone access my invoices?** | No. The app runs on `localhost` — not accessible from the internet or other computers. |
| **What if I uninstall?** | Your `data/` folder stays untouched. Reinstall anytime and everything is still there. |
| **Do I need internet?** | Only for the first install (`npm install`). After that, everything works offline. |
| **How do I backup?** | Settings → Export Data → save JSON file. Import on any machine. |

### Running on a shop LAN (POS tablets)

Since v1.10.0, the Express server accepts requests only from
`localhost` (`127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`). If you run the server on one
machine and access it from a POS tablet on the same Wi-Fi:

1. Find the server machine's LAN IP (e.g. `192.168.1.42`).
2. Open [server.js](server.js), find the CORS middleware near the top
   (search for `v1.10.0 — CORS lockdown`), and add your LAN origin
   to the allowlist regex:

   ```js
   /^https?:\/\/192\.168\.1\.42(:\d+)?$/i.test(origin) ||
   ```

3. Restart the server.
4. From the tablet's browser, hit `http://192.168.1.42:47371/`.

If you don't lock the middleware to specific IPs, any device on the
same Wi-Fi (including guests) can hit your server. That's the trade —
the default is safest, LAN access is opt-in.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Free GST Billing Software really free?
Yes — MIT licensed open-source software. No subscription, no premium tier, no "free trial" that expires, no usage limits. The full feature set is available to every user forever. We make zero rupees from this directly.

### Will my data be sent to the cloud?
No. All your invoices, clients, products, and settings are stored as plain JSON files in a `data/` folder next to the app on your computer. Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly turn on the optional Google Drive backup feature (in which case it goes to *your own* Google Drive, not ours).

### Can I file GST returns directly from this software?
The software generates **GSTR-1**, **GSTR-3B**, and **GSTR-2B reconciliation** data in CSV and the GSTN offline-tool JSON format. You upload these files directly to gst.gov.in — no third-party intermediary. The built-in step-by-step filing guide walks you through the GSTN portal once you've downloaded the files.

### Does it work without internet?
Yes, completely. After installation everything runs on `localhost:47371` on your computer. The only optional internet-using features are Google Drive backup, the in-app update notifier (checks GitHub for new versions), and WhatsApp sharing.

### Can I bill international clients?
Yes. Free GST Billing Software supports **22 countries** with locale-correct currency formatting, country-aware tax labels (GST / VAT / SST / MwSt / TVA / PPN / Sales Tax), and amount-in-words in the right currency name (Dollars, Dirhams, Pounds, Rand, Naira, Pesos, etc.). Set your Region Preference in Settings to *International* or *Both*.

### What invoice formats are supported?
**Tax Invoice**, **Proforma / Estimate**, **Bill of Supply** (for exempt goods or non-GST sellers), **Composition scheme invoice** (with Rule 46A declaration), **Credit Note**, **Delivery Challan**.

### Does it support multiple businesses?
Yes. You can add unlimited business profiles (each with its own GSTIN, bank accounts, logo, signature, and country setting). Switch between them with one click in the header.

### Does it run on Mac or Linux?
The `.bat` installers are Windows-only, but the app itself works on macOS and Linux — a NAS included — from the release ZIP (`Free GST Billing.sh`) or via `npm install` + `npm start`. See the [Quick Start](#quick-start--installation) section. From v1.10.66, **Control Panel → Update Now** also works on Linux / NAS installs made from the release ZIP (it needs `unzip` or python3); restart the app, or its container, afterwards.

### What happens to my data when the app updates?
Updates only refresh the app code and dependencies. Your `data/` folder (invoices, clients, products, settings) and `Saved Invoices/` PDF archive are **never touched**. The updater also backs them up to `%TEMP%` as a third safety net before pulling new code.

### Is there a mobile app?
Not yet — the PWA installs as a desktop app today. A native Android app is on the v2.x roadmap.

### Can I import data from Tally / Vyapar / Excel?
CSV import is supported today for clients and products. Direct Tally XML import is on the Coming Soon roadmap. Free-form Excel import requires manual mapping today.
